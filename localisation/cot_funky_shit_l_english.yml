 V01_3_desc:0 "The Munitions Act of 865 was encated by Castan XLIX Ebonfrost when he was still only a lowly reaver in order to efficiently distribute valuable Ebonsteel weapons among his soldiers.

 V01_4:0 "Olavish Stratocracy"
 V01_4_desc:0 "While the Reachmen compose a significant number of our population, their service in our kingdom will be relegated to aiding us in an economic fashion.

 V02_1:0 "School of the Hidden Spider"
